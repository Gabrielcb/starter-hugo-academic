I am currently a PhD student at University of Campinas (UNICAMP), Brazil. I have expertise in Machine Learning and Deep Learning. From 2015 to 2018 I worked on a project in partnership with Motorola to automatic estimate age of people on mobile devices, applying Deep Learning and Biometrics techniques. In 2019 I worked on SciPet Innovations applying Deep Learning and Open Set Machine Learning to recognize lost pets. Currently I work with Forensic Analysis on Events using Deep Learning, Visualization, Open Set, Unsupervised Domain Adaptation and self-supervised learning algorithms. Besides I am Teacher Assistant on Mineração de Dados Complexos promoted by Escola de Extensão da UNICAMP. During my academic life I have published in top-tier venues, being the my last work entitled "Unsupervised and Self-Adaptative Techniques for Cross-Domain Person Re-Identification" the most important one so far on my Ph.D. research, published in the prestigious IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security (T-IFS) with impact factor of 7.178.
