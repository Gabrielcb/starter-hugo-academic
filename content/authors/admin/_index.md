I am currently a Ph.D. student at University of Campinas (UNICAMP), Brazil. I have expertise in Deep Learning, Self-Supervised Learning and Computer Vision. In my current Ph.D. work I study Self-Supervised Learning and Clustering techniques to handle large unlabeled datasets tackling biases in different image semantics (People, Objects and Places) in the context of Re-Identification, and modalities (images and texts). Besides I am Teacher Assistant on Complex Data Mining promoted by Escola de Extens√£o da UNICAMP. During my academic life I have published in top-tier venues, being the my last work entitled "Unsupervised and Self-Adaptative Techniques for Cross-Domain Person Re-Identification" the most important one thus far of my Ph.D, published in the prestigious IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security (T-IFS) with impact factor of 7.178.
