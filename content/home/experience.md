    description: This is my current project that I have focused on. The ultimate goal is to design large-scale self-supervised learning solutions to filter and group                    persons, objects and places in fully-unsupervised manner avoiding biases. We envision to design solutions that can also be extended for applications                    in further Artificial Intelligence research fields.

    description: I worked in deep learning-based solutions to identify stray dogs and cats and filter out unknown classes leveraging and studying Open-Set solutions                    and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques. Research outcomes are now available, in the form of mobile applications, to some prefectures                  in Brazil
