This is my current project that I have focused on. The ultimate goal is to design large-scale self-supervised learning solutions to filter and group persons, objects and places in fully-unsupervised manner avoiding biases. We envision to design solutions that can also\
be extended for applications in further Artificial Intelligence research fields.
